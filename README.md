# Background
The overall level of debt in society is heavily influenced by the level of economic inequality and social insecurity, and no psychological factor can prevent debt if excessive socioeconomic disadvantage is not addressed. Within that constraint, psychological precursors to debt problems, psychological impacts of debt, and psychological strategies to help people get out of debt can be identified

### Key Factors Influencing Debt:
 
*Economic inequality
*Social insecurity
